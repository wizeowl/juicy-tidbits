Cialdini: Consistency
Zappos: Hiring
Leon Festinger: Cognitive Dissonance



Let's talk about cognitive dissonnance. Leon Festinger, at Stanford at the time, devised a bunch of experiments to establish the phenomenon of
cognitive dissonance.
It states that inconsitencies in the brain are very unconftable and are resolved unconsciously by the brain. the tension musrt be resolved.

Some call it the zappos tactic. 
Zappos used to have a final step in their hiring process. They propose a sum of money to the candidate and tell them they can either take the money
and leave or work for their company.
Once one makes the decision and sticks with joining the company he basically tells himself the following everyday when they wake up:
I gave up 1000$ for this job, I must really love it.

The consitency principle is a very strong motivator and influencer of human behavior.
Bob Cialdini states it as one of the strongest influencer of human behavior in his book Influence.

Sunk costs

Now let's get back to our topic.
Is it good or bad for learning to program to be hard. My opinion: it's a good thing.
Once you sweat and toil for something you grow really attached to it. It's called sunk cost.
The consitency princliple kicks in. If gets you more and more commited to it.
It becomes a riteof passage, now you're a programmer.
What happens when everything is easy? You get the wrong idea about and also you think you're a programmer withoutmaking the necessary effort
We don't need spoiled programmers


finally it's maybe not need to install python to understand the ideas
even experienced programmers find it hard to find the strenth and will power to download and get their env right at the end of a long day
that's why we need such things as Jupyter
