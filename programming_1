My first impression when reading allan's article was scepticism. You can't take complaints by people who can't run examples on their machines and conclude that starting to program is getting hard. You need at least some more data about the people who tried, those who succeded, and those who didn't. Sloppiness must follow a normal distribution.
I even firmly believed that the opposite is true. Today You can google anything after all?

It's hard for us to recognize it because we already can sift through the deluge of information innundating us from every side.
We can distinguish the good from the bad, the relevant from the outdated.
Programming languages are getting really numerous, each with its own communities, resources, articles, tutorials, videos, youtube videos, books, etc.
Many of which need real expertise to know it's fluff
Many buzz words

So let's just admit that one can't unlearn how to program to feel how hard it is to get started, just like it's hard to unlearn how to read. that's why that stroop test is such a bummer.
(I have the intention to teach somebody programming but that's another story)
