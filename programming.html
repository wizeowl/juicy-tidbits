        Yesterday, I've read Allen Downey's article <a
            href="http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/learning-to-program-is-getting-harder.html">Learning to
        program is
        getting harder</a>. The article mainly pointed that if you need to start programming today you have to first do
        things which have no intrinsic values like seting up editors, configuring libraries, binaries, etc.
        This constitutes a barrier which distracts from the main purpose, be it learning subjects such as data analysis,
        signal processing, or learning programming itself.
        He argued that, let's say 30 years ago, a computer came bundled with a development environement and you didn't
        have
        to be hassled by installation and configurations.
        He also remarked that beginners are finding it harder to run the examples he provided with his books.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the present article, I'm going to comment on further barriers newbies encounter during their entry to the
        field.
        Then I'm going to argue that though the complexity is accidental, it's in some respects beneficial.

        My first impression when reading Allan's article was scepticism. Based on a few complaints by people who
        couldn't run examples on their machines, one can't conclude that beginning to program is getting harder. You
        need more data about the people who tried, those who succeded, and those who didn't. Sloppiness must follow a
        normal distribution.
        I actually firmly believed that the opposite was true. Today You can google anything, right?
    </p>

        I smiled, because only one day earlier, I was lamenting how we're teaching children everything the wrong way.
        From reading and writing to math, taking the categories, rules and heuristics we develop to formalize a subject,
        and trying to impose them on students. We pretend that's the way we learned those subjects, but in reality, we
        have no idea how we made our first steps and developed our mental models in the first place. It's impossible to
        unlearn how to program, just like it's impossible to unlearn how to read (that's why that stroop test is such a
        bummer). Therefore it's impossible for us to put ourselves in the shoes of absolute beginners. But we pretend
        that we learned effortlessly and we saw it all along exactly the way we currently do. It's a variant of
        generational conflict which reminds me of a George Orwell quote I really love "Every generation imagines itself
        to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it."
    </p>
    <p>
        Today there are numerous programming languages, each with their own articles, tutorials, youtube videos, books,
        advocates, cults, buzzword, buzzwords, buzzwords, and shriek, frameworks! Of course we can google anything, but
        there are many things which happen when I (for example) look for information. It makes a difference how I write
        my questions, which google results look relevant, what to skip and what to read in a long forum thread, is the
        solution I'm looking at plausible and applicable, etc.

        My favorite badass is Brian Stroustrup (He's the inventor of C++ by the way). When I've read <a
            href="http://smorgasborg.artlung.com/Invention_of_Cplusplus.shtml">this interview</a> I thought it was a
        joke. What he said was basically that programmers were getting numerous and more proficient that wages started
        to stagnate. So he jumped on the OOP bandwagon and introduced an inferior programming language called C++. Let's
        give him credit for his noble intentions, but let's not overlook that the Internet, modern operating systems,
        and browsers came along, introducing new constraints and requirements. That's how languages like Java and
        Javascripts were born (we're sadly still stuck with Java). Furthermore, it was no longer viable to assume the
        end user had any knowledge of programming or any intentions to do so.

        I'm not suggesting that writing the first "Hello world!" and for loop is getting harder, on the contrary it's
        easier than ever.
        But learning to program well is indeed what became harder. There's some pain and a lot of trial and error during
        the learning process.
        Every trade has it's own rites of initiation and of passage, some hurdles to overcome, some pain to withstand.
        When one makes substantial effort to implement and learn something, it constitutes a motivator to further
        justify their investments.
        There are three psychological factors into play in my opinion: Cognitive dissonance, loss aversion, and
        consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html">Cognitive dissonance</a> is a psychology
        model which states that the human brain abhors contradiction.
        Anytime one has conflicting ideas and or behaviors, the brain resolves the tension by changing behviors, or
        altering beliefs, unconciously, doing anything available.
    </p>
    <p>
        This isn't merely an intellectual curiosity, it has strong practical applications, notably in the Zappos hiring
        process.
        Zappos is a company, renowned for its impeccable customer service and high employee satisfaction.
        It's notorious for an odd practice in the final step of their hiring process. At the end of the first week of a
        new employee at the company, they present an ultimatum
        <a href="http://managerfoundation.com/blog/zappos-hiring-for-culture-and-the-bizarre-things-they-do#.Wp1VGB3ibVN">To
            accept a $3000 money sum and leave the company immediately, no strings attached or to reject the money and
            work for the company.</a>
        Once one makes the choice, an particular idea is installed in their brain. I rejected $3000 to work in this
        company, I must love working here.
        By th way, only 2% to 3% take the money.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second principle is loss aversion: The tendency to over-value what we already possess and feel pain at its
        loss.
        When we spend time and effort on learning a subject, we're extremely reluctant to let go.
        In business sunk costs designate the costs and expenditures which have been spent in the past on a project,
        product, company, etc.
        There's one rule they teach in business school: Sunk costs don't matter, only future returns make future
        decisions.
        But in practice everybody pouring money into loosing enterprises in the hope of making up for past losses.
        The concept of sunk costs can be generalized to other fields.
        And in the field of computer science like in any other field, it's double edged sword. It can motivate us to
        further learn and become proficient in the things we spent time to learn, but can also lead us to sometimes deny
        that we learned outdated material, developed bad habits, or generally need to renew our knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        The consitency principle is another strong motivator of human behavior. It states that once we make a choice or
        hold a belief, we tend to think and act in consistency with the choice made. <a
            href="http://stephentully.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Influence.pdf">Robert Cialdini states it as one of
        the strongest influencers of human behavior </a> in his book Influence.
        Once one makes effort to learn programming, it becomes easier to make the same decision again.
        One becomes someone who loves programming, you're the kind of person who spends the night on a tutorial rather
        than watching movie.

        Finally, maybe the people in allan's article are not spoiled, they maybe lifelong learners, young people, people
        with limited knowledge of systems administration, and python and pip, and installing the anaconda bundle. Even
        experienced programmers sometimes lack will power to download and get their environments up and running at the
        end of a long day. But today we also have some excellent solutions exactly for exactly these needs such things
        as Jupyter

        (finally, a small aside on the blog title: "Probably Overthinking it". It could have been my blog's title :)
