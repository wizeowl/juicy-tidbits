Leon Festinger: Cognitive Dissonance https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html

I'm not suggesting that writing the first "Hello world!" and for loop is getting harder, on the contrary it's easier than ever.
But learning to program well is indeed what became harder. There's some pain and a lot of trial and error during the learning process.
Every trade has it's own rites of initiation and of passage, some hurdles to overcome, some pain to withstand.
When one makes substantial effort to implement and learn something, it constitutes a motivator to further justify their investments.
There are three psychological factors into play in my opinion: Cognitive dissonance, loss aversion, and consistency.

Cognitive dissonance is a psychology model which states that the human brain abhors contradiction.
Anytime one has conflicting ideas and or behaviors, the brain resolves the tension by changing behviors, or altering beliefs, unconciously, doing anything available.
This isn't merely an intellectual curiosity, it has strong practical applications, notably in the Zappos hiring process.
Zappos is a company, renowned for its impeccable customer service and high employee satisfaction.
It's notorious for an odd practice in the final step of their hiring process. At the end of the first week of a new employee at the company, they present an ultimatum
To accept a $3000 money sum and leave the company immediately, no strings attached or to reject the money and work for the company.
Once one makes the choice, an particular idea is installed in their brain. I rejected $3000 to work in this company, I must love working here.
By th way, only 2% to 3% take the money.

The second principle is loss aversion: The tendency to over-value what we already possess and feel pain at its loss.
When we spend time and effort on learning a subject, we're extremely reluctant to let go.
In business sunk costs designate the costs and expenditures which have been spent in the past on a project, product, company, etc.
There's one rule they teach in business school: Sunk costs don't matter, only future returns make future decisions.
But in practice everybody pouring money into loosing enterprises in the hope of making up for past losses.
The concept of sunk costs can be generalized to other fields.
And in the field of computer science like in any other field, it's double edged sword. It can motivate us to further learn and become proficient in the things we spent time to learn, but can also lead us to sometimes deny that we learned outdated material, developed bad habits, or generally need to renew our knowledge.

The consitency principle is another strong motivator of human behavior. It states that once we make a choice or hold a belief, we tend to think and act in consistency with the choice made. Robert Cialdini states it as one of the strongest influencers of human behavior in his book Influence.
Once one makes effort to learn programming, it becomes easier to make the same decision again.
One becomes someone who loves programming, you're the kind of person who spends the night on a tutorial rather than watching movie.

Finally, maybe the people in allan's article are not spoiled, they maybe lifelong learners, young people, people with limited knowledge of systems administration, and python and pip, and installing the anaconda bundle. Even experienced programmers sometimes lack will power to download and get their environments up and running at the end of a long day. But today we also have some excellent solutions exactly for exactly these needs such things as Jupyter

(finally, a small aside on the blog title: "Probably Overthinking it". It could have been my blog's title :)
